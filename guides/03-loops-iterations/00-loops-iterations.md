#### for loop
> repeat untils a specified condition to false, generally to a number

#### do...while
> repeats until the specified condition evaluates to false
> with execution of atleast 1 time.

#### while
> repeats until the condition to true
> number of execution of block can be 0 or more.

#### label, break, continue
> break breaks the execution of loops
> continue continues the exection to next iteration
> label specifically to transfer execution control to another place

> loops over enumerable properties of an object.
> arrays might iterate other properties too.
