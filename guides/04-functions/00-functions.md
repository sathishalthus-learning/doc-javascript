### Functions
> - fundamental building blocks of javascript
> - set of statements to perform a task
> - might return a value

#### Defining Functions
> * consist of keyword **function** 
> * followed by **name** of the function
> * list of parameters inside parantheses
> * block of statement enclosed by curly braces.
> * parameteres are passed by **value**.
> * when **object** passed , object's properties are changed that are visible outside.
> * when **array** is passed , changes are visible outside.

#### Function Expressions
> + syntactically a expression, a name is assigned
> + can have variable name and may be a function name too.

#### Calling Functions
> + calling is actually performs the action defined in functions.
> + a function can call itself (recursive).
##### Function hoisting
- function declarations are hoisted to top of current scope
- hoisting only allowed with function definitions, not allowed in function expresions
##### Recursion
##### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions IIFE
- directly called a function defined as an expression

#### Scopes and Closures
> + variables declared inside a function is not accesible outside the functions.
> + functions inherits all from upper scopes
> + closure is the body of a function

#### Arguements object
> arguments passed to a function can be accessed as array

#### Function Parameters
> default parameters, rest parameters
##### Default Parameter
